Such dependence, and the increased electrification, leaves power grids vulnerable to the risk of negative impacts of climate-induced weather extremes. Nevertheless, the effects of extreme events on the reliability of electricity distribution systems remain an open question, and to address this point, IM-POWER is proposed here. The Action aims to develop a numerical integrated model to predict the power generation performance of emerging offshore wind technologies during storm conditions and anticipate their impact on power grids. IM-POWER will set a comprehensive numerical strategy to assess the power output of offshore wind farms that comprise wind turbines installed on floating platforms. High-fidelity modeling techniques for simulating marine structures and harsh marine conditions \u2013 involving wind effects, floating foundations, and power generators \u2013 will be combined. Three representative configurations of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) will be arrayed into wind farms. To provide relevance to the layouts, their design will be tackled in cooperation with the world-leading project developer Hexicon AB (Sweden). Therefore, the computational tool will be used to investigate the power output of  the FOWTs by assessing their transient response when the peak of storms (usually lasting three or four hours) hits the wind farm. Owing to the effort required by the numerical procedure, hardware acceleration provided by the National Supercomputer Centre (Sweden) will be used to perform the calculations. The knowledge gained from the power production variability during storms using IM-POWER, for different platform configurations, will permeate FOWT design and optimization procedures, and support power grid upgrades. </p>"},{"location":"info/#inputs","title":"Inputs","text":""},{"location":"info/#current_file","title":"Current File","text":"<p>Here is the file I\u2019m looking at.

The reasoning is simple: offshore wind resources are greater and more constant due to the absence of barriers, and not to be discounted is its greater acceptance by the public. As such, in Europe and globally, large installations of offshore wind farms are being planned and realized at faster rates.</p> <p>Large knowledge gaps still remain regarding the performance and reliability of offshore wind systems in storm conditions, and how they could impact power grid reliability. A case study for Sweden suggests that extreme climate events can greatly challenge power systems, when 50% of intermittent renewable energy (IRE) is plugged in.</p> <p>The objectives of this Action are complex, and interdisciplinary challenges will require combining state-of-the-art methods in modelling wind and wave loads; wind farm response (including dynamics, structural response, and power control); as well as grid balance and reliability.

In relatively shallow water (up to 50 meters depth), fixed-foundation wind turbines are employed, essentially preserving the structural features of onshore twins. To increase the installation depths, floating structures must be used. These platforms are stabilized by moorings and anchors that flexibly connect them to fixed points on the seabed, thus safely providing support in up to 300 meters of water depth. Floating wind farms comprise wind turbines that are placed on platforms, and connected to an offshore substation through submarine cables to transmit the generated electricity (Figure 1). Such complexity reflects into its average total cost per megawatt-hour over its lifetime (known as Levelised Cost of Energy \u2013 LCOE), which is still high, even if compared with fixed-foundation offshore wind: this is what has hampered its use at large scales so far.</p> <p></p> <p>To reduce the LCOE and thus unlock the potential of offshore wind, floating platforms under high-impact low-probability (HILP) events need to be studied to allow more efficient and accurate design procedures. One of the investigative tools that can reliably inform on the structural response of FOWTs is numerical modeling. A large body of research suggests that high-fidelity computational techniques, usually known as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, are required to accurately simulate the fluid-platform interaction under highly-energetic waves, thereby obtaining reliable model results.</p>"},{"location":"info/#beyond_the_state_of_the_art_and_innovative_aspects_of_the_research_program","title":"Beyond the state of the art and innovative aspects of the research program","text":"<p>The Action will set a cutting-edge CFD platform that portrays the first open-source software able to precisely simulate FOWTs, with high accuracy and robustness.

Due to the large scale of wind farms (on the order of km) and the high level of detail required to simulate wind and wave interactions with the turbine (on the order of tens of cm), a multi-tier modelling procedure is necessary to reduce the overall complexity, as postulated in RO1. In fact, as of now, the straightforward simulation of whole wind farms is prohibitive on account of the computational costs and hardware requirements. The farm total power output can be anticipated by breaking down the simulation of a farm to the wind-turbine level, thereby reconstructing it through integration. The outcome consistency is guaranteed by coherent environmental loads (wind profiles and waves) as generated by time-integrated numerical models for wave and wind propagation. In the following Blocks of Work (BoWs), a preliminary description of the activities to be performed are presented:</p> <ul> <li>BoW 1: Feature design and implementation.

A testing area is identified for the characterization of the storm pattern; definition of the local wave input by propagating real sea states for the entirety of the farm stretch of sea; definition of the park arrangement, comprising anchoring systems and power connectivity.

The results of the Action can help optimize the supporting structures, thus delivering more overall economic feasibility.</p> <p>Second of all, the project main outcome will provide useful knowledge to strengthen grid reliability. Grid inter-connectivity is tremendously important since it comes with several technical advantages that offshore wind sources would need to improve their cost effectiveness: especially the possibility of balancing loads at great distances.

Another drawback of using DBC arises when considering the steady-state 2D channel flows such as Poiseuille and Couette flows, as the boundary layer is not accurately solved unless a high resolution is used. The approximation of no-slip by setting zero velocity at each of the boundary particles fails to capture the condition for low resolutions. This then leads to higher than expected velocities close to the boundary and throughout the flow. Despite all this, DBC can be successfully used for coastal engineering problems due the capability of discretizing complex 3D geometries without the need of implementing complex mirroring techniques or semi-analytical wall boundary conditions. </p> <p>We will describe here the approach presented in [English et al. 2019] that includes a modification of DBC (mDBC). Within this implementation, the boundary particles are arranged in the same way as the boundary particles in the original DBC, with the boundary interface located half a particle spacing from the inner most layer of boundary particles. For each boundary particle a ghost node is projected into the fluid across the boundary interface in a similar procedure to [Marrone et al. 2011]. For a flat surface the ghost node is mirrored across the boundary interface along the direction of the boundary normal pointing into the fluid (Figure 3-1a) and fluid properties are found at this ghost node through a corrected SPH sum over the surrounding fluid particles only (Figure 3-1b). For a boundary particle located in a corner using the boundary normal would not work due to the presence of more than one normal. However, the boundary interfaces of each solid boundary meet to form an interface corner, and the ghost node is mirrored through the point of this corner into the fluid region (Figure 3-1c). Again, fluid properties are found at the ghost node through a corrected SPH sum of the surrounding fluid (Figure 3-1d). </p> <p> </p> <p> Figure 3-1.

The new interaction requires the inversion of the matrix A<sub>g</sub>; however, this requires limited additional computational efforts when compared to the original DBC formulation. Note also that the matrix A<sub>g</sub> is diagonally dominant so rarely becomes ill-conditioned, even for a very disordered particle distribution. Due to this property, the adopted formulation to compute \u03c1<sub>g</sub>  and [\u2202<sub>x</sub>\u03c1<sub>g</sub>;\u2202<sub>y</sub>\u03c1<sub>g</sub>;\u2202<sub>z</sub>\u03c1<sub>g</sub>] is still suitable for real engineering applications with fragmented free surfaces.

The velocity at the ghost node is found using a Shepard filter sum </p> <p>  (43)    </p> <p>The boundary particle then receives this velocity with the direction reversed to create a no-slip condition at the boundary interface. The no-slip condition created using this method is more accurate than using the zero-velocity approach of the original DBC as the negative velocity is more effective at reducing the velocity of the fluid. With this method it is also possible to create a free slip boundary by giving the boundary particles the exact tangential velocity found at the ghost node.</p>"},{"location":"figures/fundamentals/","title":"SPH Formulation","text":"<p>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian meshless method.

Due to truncation of the kernel (there are no particles being sampled outside of an open boundary), the first-order contributions are not null [Antuono et al., 2010], resulting in a net force applied to the particles. This effect is not considered relevant for nonhydrostatic situations, where this force is many orders of magnitude inferior to any other force involved. Corrections to this effect were proposed by [Antuono et al., 2010], but involve the solution of a renormalization problem for the density gradient, with considerable computational cost. A (\u03b4<sub>\u03a6</sub>) coefficient of 0.1 is recommended for most applications.</p> <p>The work of [Fourtakas et al., 2020] introduces a correction in Eq. (15.2). The key idea is to use the same formulation proposed by [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009] but substituting the dynamic density with the total one. Thus, the term \u03c8<sub>ab</sub> takes the following form,</p> <p>  (16)   </p> <p>where the superscript D denotes the dynamic density or pressure. Since \u03c1<sub>D</sub>=\u03c1<sub>T</sub>-\u03c1<sub>H</sub> (where superscript T and H denote the total and hydrostatic component, respectively), Eq. (16) can be rewritten in term of the hydrostatic and total parts as, </p> <p>  (17)   </p> <p>In the context of the weakly compressible SPH, the equation of state relates the density to the total pressure at the particle location. However, only the hydrostatic part of the pressure is needed. Using the equation of state (EOS), the hydrostatic density difference can be obtained by,</p> <p>  (18)  </p> <p>The term P<sup>H</sup> is simply the hydrostatic pressure difference of particle a and b,</p> <p>  (19)  </p> <p>where z<sub>ab</sub> is the vertical distance between particle a and b and</p> <p>  (20)    </p> <p>In comparison with the formulation of the diffusive term proposed by [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009] of Eq. (15.2), Eq. (16) improves the behaviour of pressure near the wall boundaries by avoiding the troublesome dynamic pressure and avoiding to compute the normalized density gradient. However, it must be noted that the formulation of [Antuono et al., 2010] is consistent and it can be adopted for any type of flow, whereas the use of total density in the diffusive term of Eq. (16) is expected to work better than Eq. (15.2) mostly for gravity-dominated flows. In the absence of a gravity force the formulation collapses to the original formulation of [Molteni and Colagrossi, 2009].</p>"},{"location":"figures/fundamentals/#36_shifting_algorithm","title":"3.6 Shifting algorithm","text":"<p>Anisotropic particle spacing is an important stability issue in SPH as, especially in violent flows, particles cannot maintain a uniform distribution. The result is the introduction of noise in the velocity and pressure field, as well as the creation of voids within the water flow for certain cases.</p> <p>To counter the anisotropic particle spacing, [Xu et al., 2009] proposed a particle shifting algorithm to prevent the instabilities. The algorithm was first created for incompressible SPH, but can be extended to the weakly compressible SPH model used in DualSPHysics [Vacondio et al., 2013]. With the shifting algorithm, the particles are moved (\u201cshifted\u201d) towards areas with fewer particles (lower particle concentration) allowing the domain to maintain a uniform particle distribution and eliminating any voids that may occur due to the noise.</p> <p>An improvement on the initial shifting algorithm was proposed by [Lind et al., 2012] who used Fick\u2019s first law of diffusion to control the shifting magnitude and direction. Fick\u2019s first law connects the diffusion flux to the concentration gradient:</p> <p>  (21) </p> <p>where J is the flux, C the particle concentration, and D<sub>F</sub> the Fickian diffusion coefficient.</p> <p>Assuming that the flux, i.e. the number of particles passing through a unit surface in unit time, is proportional to the velocity of the particles, a particle shifting velocity and subsequently a particle shifting distance can be found. Using the particle concentration, the particle shifting distance \u03b4r<sub>s</sub> is given by:</p> <p>  (22) </p> <p>where D is a new diffusion coefficient that controls the shifting magnitude and absorbs the constants of proportionality. The gradient of the particle concentration can be found through an SPH gradient operator:</p> <p>  (23) </p> <p>The proportionality coefficient D is computed through a form proposed by [Skillen et al., 2013]. It is set to be large enough to provide effective particle shifting, while not introducing significant errors or instabilities. This is achieved by performing a Von Neumann stability analysis of the advection-diffusion equation:</p> <p>  (24) </p> <p>where \u0394t<sub>max</sub> is the maximum local time step that is permitted by the CFL condition for a given local velocity and particle spacing. The CFL condition states that:</p> <p>  (25) </p> <p>Combining Eq. 24 and 25 we can derive an equation to find the shifting coefficient D:</p> <p>  (26) </p> <p>where A is a dimensionless constant that is independent of the problem setup and discretization and dt is the current time step. Values in the range of [1,6] are proposed with 2 used as default.</p> <p>The shifting algorithm is heavily dependent on a full kernel support. However, particles at and adjacent to the free surface cannot obtain the full kernel support, which will introduce errors in the free-surface prediction, potentially causing non-physical instabilities. Applying Fick\u2019s law directly would result in the rapid diffusion of fluid particles from the fluid bulk, due to the large concentration gradients at the free surface.</p> <p>To counter this effect, [Lind et al., 2012] proposed a free-surface correction that limits diffusion to the surface normal but allow shifting on the tangent to the free surface. Therefore, this correction is only used near the free surface, identified by the value of the particle divergence, which is computed through the following equation, first proposed by [Lee et al., 2008]:</p> <p>  (27) </p> <p>This idea is applied to the DualSPHysics code by multiplying the shifting distance of Equation (22) with a free-surface correction coefficient AFSC.</p> <p>  (28.1) </p> <p>where AFST is the free-surface threshold and AFSM is the maximum value of the particle divergence. The latter depends on the domain dimensions:</p> <p>  (28.2) </p> <p>while the free surface threshold is selected for DualSPHysics as:</p> <p>  (28.3) </p> <p>To identify the position of the particle relative to the free surface, the difference of the particle divergence to AFST is used. Therefore, the full shifting equation (Eq. 22) with the free surface correction is:</p> <p>  (29)       </p> <p>More information about the shifting implementation can be found in [Mokos, 2013].</p>"},{"location":"figures/fundamentals/#37_time_stepping","title":"3.7 Time stepping","text":"<p>In DualSPHysics two explicit time integration schemes are implemented.

GPUs are designed to manage huge amounts of data and their computing power has developed in recent years much faster than conventional central processing units (CPUs).  Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel programming framework and language for GPU computing using some extensions to the C/C++ language. Researchers and engineers of different fields are achieving high speedups implementing their codes with the CUDA language. Thus, the parallel power computing of GPUs can be also applied for SPH methods where the same loops for each particle during the simulation can be parallelised. </p> <p>DualSPHysics is implemented in C++ and CUDA language to carry out simulations with millions of particles on either the CPU or GPU respectively. The new CPU code presents some advantages, such as more optimised use of the memory. The object- oriented programming paradigm provides a code that is easy to understand, maintain and modify with a sophisticated control of errors available. Furthermore, better optimisations are implemented, for example particles are reordered to give faster access to memory, and the best approach to create the neighbour list is implemented [Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2011]. The CUDA language manages the parallel execution of threads on the GPUs. The best approaches were considered to be implemented as an extension of the C++ code, so the most appropriate optimizations to parallelise particle interaction on GPU were implemented [Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2013a; 2013b]. The first rigorous validations were presented in [Crespo et al., 2011]. The version 3.0 of the code is fully documented in [Crespo et al., 2015]. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Author Name.

In relatively shallow waters (up to 50 meters depth), fixed-foundation wind turbines are employed, essentially preserving the structural features of onshore twins. To increase the installation depths, floating structures have been considered. Such platforms are stabilized by moorings and anchors that flexibly connect them to fixed points on the seabed, thus safely providing support in up to 300 meters of water depth (Lauria et al. 2024). Floating wind farms comprise wind turbines that are placed on platforms, and connected to an offshore substation through submarine cables to transmit the generated electricity (Figure 1). Such complexity reflects into its average total cost per megawatt-hour over its lifetime (known as Levelised Cost of Energy \u2013 LCOE), which is still high, even if compared with fixed-foundation offshore wind . This high cost is what has hampered its use at large scales so far. Currently, there is 113 MW of floating wind in operation in Europe, spread across a few pilot plants.

The straightforward simulation of whole wind farms is currently prohibitive due to computational costs and hardware requirements, as highlighted in recent reviews of CFD applications for FOWTs (Zhang et al. 2024).
